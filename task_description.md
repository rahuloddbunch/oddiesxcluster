just make the hero text on homepage pink

# Tasks

## Task 1

**Type:** modify_theme_component

Change the homepage hero text color to pink. Update the hero section stylesheet (or add a CSS override scoped to the homepage hero) so the primary headline and supporting subtitle use a pink color (e.g. #ff69b4) on all viewports, without changing global typography. If the theme already exposes a hero text color setting, update that setting instead; otherwise add a simple section setting so the merchant can adjust the color later.
