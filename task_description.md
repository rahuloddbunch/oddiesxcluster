# Original User Instructions

add trust icons below the atc button indicating

- no lock in 
- money back guarantee 
- ships in 2-3 business days

# Tasks

## Task 1

**Type:** modify_theme_component

Add a row of three trust icons with short labels directly below the product page Add to Cart button (and in the product quick-view/modal if the theme has one). Use the theme's existing icon set or inline SVGs for: “No lock in”, “Money-back guarantee”, and “Ships in 2–3 business days”, and ensure the row wraps on narrow viewports and matches the theme's spacing and color scale.

## Task 2

**Type:** custom_data_modeling

Add theme settings to let the merchant enable/disable the trust badge row and toggle or edit each badge's label and icon from the theme editor. Store defaults in the section/schema so the badges show sensible default text/icons if the merchant does not customize them.
