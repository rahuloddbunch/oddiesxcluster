# Tasks

## Task 1

**Type:** modify_theme_component

Change the homepage so its visible text uses a pink color. Implement by adding a CSS rule scoped to the homepage template (e.g. .template-index or body.template-index) that targets main heading and paragraph elements (h1â€“h3, p, .rte) and sets their color to a pink value (suggested #ff66b2). Ensure the rule only applies on the homepage so other pages are not affected.
